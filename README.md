# Drum-Kit
This app includes a function that plays a sound file when a button on the drum kit is clicked or when a specific keyboard key is pressed. It also includes a function that adds a "pressed" class to the button or keyboard key that was pressed, and then removes the class after a short delay. The script uses a switch statement to determine which sound file should be played based on the button or key that was pressed. It also uses the document object to access and manipulate elements on the web page, as well as to listen for events such as button clicks and key presses.
